    <h1>MY FAVORITE TV Series</h1>
    <h2>Prison Break</h2>
    <p>
        Prison Break is an American television serial drama created by Paul Scheuring for Fox.
        <br>
        The series revolves around two brothers, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller); Burrows has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, and Scofield devises an elaborate plan to help his brother escape prison and clear his name.
        <br>
        The series was produced by Adelstein-Parouse Productions, in association with Original Film and 20th Century Fox Television.
        <br>
        Along with creator Paul Scheuring, the series is executive produced by Matt Olmstead, Kevin Hooks, Marty Adelstein, Dawn Parouse, Neal H. Moritz, and Brett Ratner who directed the pilot episode.
        <br>
        The series' theme music, composed by Ramin Djawadi, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2006.
        <br>
        Prison Break is a joint production between Original Film, Adelstein/Parouse Productions, and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.
        <br>
        The series was originally turned down by Fox in 2003, which was concerned about the long-term prospects of such a series.
        <br>
        Following the popularity of serialized prime time television series Lost and 24, Fox decided to back production in 2004.
        <br>
        The first season received mostly positive reviews from critics with universal acclaim from audiences.
        <br>
        The season performed exceptionally in the ratings. The first season was originally planned for a 13-episode run, but was extended to include an extra nine episodes due to its popularity.
        <br>
        The following seasons, however, received generally positive-to-mixed reviews, with some critics claiming the show had overstayed its welcome.
        <br>
        Prison Break was nominated for several industry awards, including the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Drama and the 2006 People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama, which it won.
        <br>
        In the United States, all five seasons have been released on DVD and released on Blu-ray internationally.
        <br>
        The success of the series has inspired short videos for mobile phones, several official tie-ins in print and on the Internet, and a video game.
        <br>
        A spin-off series, Prison Break: Proof of Innocence, was produced exclusively for mobile phones.
        <br>
        The series has spawned an official magazine and a tie-in novel.
        <br>
        The fourth season of Prison Break returned from its mid-season break in a new timeslot on April 17, 2009, for the series' last six episodes.
        <br>
        Two additional episodes, titled "The Old Ball and Chain" and "Free" were produced, and were later transformed into a standalone feature, titled The Final Break.
        <br>
        The events of this feature take place before the last scene of the series finale, and are intended to conclude unfinished plotlines.
        <br>
        The feature was released on DVD and Blu-ray July 21, 2009.
