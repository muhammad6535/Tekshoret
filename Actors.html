                <p>played by Dominic Purcell, is a fictional character and one of the two protagonists of the American television series Prison Break.
                    The plot of Prison Break revolves around Lincoln being framed for the murder of the Vice President's brother and Lincoln's brother, Michael Scofield’s (Wentworth Miller) plan to help him escape his death sentence.
                    In flashbacks, teenage Lincoln is played by Max Kirsch, and for one episode, Hunter Jablonski.
                    As one of the principal characters, Lincoln plays a prominent role in the series and appeared in every episode.
                    The brothers' relationship is frequently explored in the series as their sacrifices for each other form a large part of the plot.
                    In an interview, series creator Paul Scheuring commented that it was "extremely difficult" to cast the roles of Lincoln and Michael.
                    Dominic Purcell was cast for the role just three days before the start of production of the series pilot.</p>

                <p>Michael Scofield, portrayed by Wentworth Miller, is a fictional character and one of the two main protagonists of the American television series Prison Break.
                    The character first appeared in the series pilot, in which he deliberately sends himself to prison so as to break his elder brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), out before his execution for a crime he did not commit.
                    The storyline of the first season revolves around the two brothers and Michael's plan to help Lincoln escape his death sentence.
                    Later seasons detail their life on the run and their quest for the truth behind Lincoln's imprisonment.
                    As the principal character, Michael has been featured in every episode of the series.
                    Although both Lincoln and Michael are the main protagonists of the series, Michael has been featured more extensively than Lincoln, especially in the first season and the third.
                    Various flashbacks from subsequent episodes provide further insight into the relationship between Michael and his brother, and the reasons behind Michael's determination in helping Lincoln to escape his death sentence.
                    In the episode flashbacks, the younger Michael is played by Dylan Minnette.
                    It is later revealed that Michael has low latent inhibition, a perceptually differing condition in which one sees the world as pieces, rather than mere objects.</p>
